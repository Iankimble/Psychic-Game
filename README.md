<!-- I used bootstrap and some internal css stylings to customize the page-->
<!-- my plan was to create an array that would cotiain the first 10 letters of the alphabet. The
I borrowed the span code from a previous assignement to create a user input feature that would appear on the screen on clicking the key
I reviewed the rock-paper-scicsor assignment and web articles but I was not able to translate the information to create a random letter selector
for the computer guess 
I would have used math. random to acheive the random letter input
I would then use an if/else statement to determine if the user selection matched with the computer selection
another thing I took note of in the rock-paper-scicsor assignment was inner html class that would allow the user to see the results of 
their input.-->
